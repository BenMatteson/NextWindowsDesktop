# NextWindowsDesktop
AutoHotkey script that adds a hotkey to advance to the next image for slidshow backgrounds in windows

Default hotkey is __Win+N__, which will do the same thing as selecting "Next Desktop Background" from the right click menu on the desktop (it actually does this). if that option is not available, you will need to set the desktop to a slideshow. (using this script while not set to a slideshow may cause unexpected behavior such as opening the NVIDIA Control Panel)
